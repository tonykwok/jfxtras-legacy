/**
 * This class only exists because JavaFX (as of v1.2) cannot implement a Java interface that
 * returns a primitive type.  The JavaFX compiler is not smart enough to unbox the Integer
 * automatically and therefore it mismatches on the return type and generates a compiler error.
 *
 * The solution implemented here is to insert an abstract Java class into the hierarchy as an
 * adaptor that implements the problematic interface method by calling into a JavaFX-friendly
 * version of the method and doing the unboxing manually.  The JavaFX class, then, will extend
 * this class rather than implement the original interface.
