Building JFXtras using Maven
--------------------------------------
Maven can be used to build the JFXtras project. There are three steps necessary:


Install the JavaFX SDK to your local repository
===============================================

Unfortunately the Javafx SKD cannot be uploaded to Maven central (licensing issue...). But there exists a plugin that solves that problem. This plugin is deployed to Maven central. Therefore it is just necessary to call:

	mvn org.jfxtras:javafx-maven-plugin:install-sdk-jars

The plugin tries to find the SDK location. If it is not successful, you might want to set the location using the property "javafx.home":

	mvn org.jfxtras:javafx-maven-plugin:install-sdk-jars -Djavafx.home=<path/to/javafx/sdk>


Installing the parent
=====================

There exists a parent pom that contains the common configurations. The parent can be found at its own repository: http://code.google.com/p/jfxtras/source/checkout?repo=parent It is just necessary to call "mvn install" within the project.

	hg clone https://parent.jfxtras.googlecode.com/hg/ jfxtras-parent  
	cd jfxtras-parent
	mvn install


Installing JFXtras
==================

JFXtras can then be build using Maven. Just checkout the sources and call "mvn install"

	hg clone https://jfxtras.googlecode.com/hg/ jfxtras  
	cd jfxtras
	mvn install
