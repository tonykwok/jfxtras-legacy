jfxtras - Utilities and Add-ons for the JavaFXâ„¢ Platform

The purpose of the JFXtra project is to create a package of essential add-ons and utilities for the JavaFX Script language that fill in gaps that application developers need.

We are currently in the process of retooling for the JavaFX 2.0 release.

Volunteers and contributions are very welcome!  Please join the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jfxtras-users)!

Project values:
* Language - While we support alternative languages for developing JavaFX applications, we use 100% native Java code to provide maximum extensibility of our components.
* Quality - We put our reputation behind everything we release with thorough testing and documentation.
* Community - We are real developers building real applications on JavaFX, and will prioritize the needs of the community over everything else.
